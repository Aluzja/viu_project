    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      Hi there, My name is Taelyn. for this project here I've decided to do a photography website but I'm not really a
      photographer, Instead I enjoy digital drawing, painting, and animating. My favourite color is blue and my
      favourite animals are parrots, octopi, dogs, cats, and geese. I've been a VIU student since September 2023 with
      the help of the CTC Program whcich allows highschool students in their last year of school take university
      courses, I took a basic painting/color theory/shapes/depth/form class and a 3d building class and we got to make
      things out of cardboard, I made a giant lizard for the final project of that class.
